# Backend test
Completion for the following test: https://github.com/tembici/desafio-backend
The proposal for the test is also present in 'instructions.md' file.

## Running the API
To run the the API run the following:

``` bash
./setup.sh
flask run
```

Make sure that you have dependencies installed.

## Dependencies
+ Python 3.7.3;
+ virtualenv (See 'Virtual Environment');
+ SQLite3 (make sure to have it installed before compiling python, so the lib is present).

## Virtual Environment
I'm using a python virtual enviroment, python version 3.7.3. To create a python virtual envivorment run the following, assuming not having the virtualenv installed on your pc and a *NIX system.

``` bash
# Install virtualenv and create virtual enviroment
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --python=/path/to/python /path/to/env

# Activate virtual enviroment and install requirements
. /path/to/env/bin/active
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes on choices
I choosed SQLite3 for simplicity. It is easy to use and reset. But it also has negative aspects. There are not many data types. For the tokens and hashes, the TEXT data type is used. May not be the best or most efficient way of storing them.
SQLAlchemy helps a lot with Python/SQLite3 interface, mapping objects to tables. I didn't use the flask extension for it for learning reasons.

## To do
+ It is working, but it still needs some refactoring;
+ Add unit tests.
